File management solution for submitting hw on time without the internet

This application looks into your windows event log files and determines if you have changed your time.
It offers the output of a txt file or a string output of all the recent changes (to some cutoff).

This was a project I worked on during the MIT hackathon with a few of my friends.
This is only half of the project, the javafx was implemented on my friends repository.
